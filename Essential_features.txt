inode number of every file:  ls -il
it is the unique identifier mapped with every file stored in the harddrive

this will remove the alias created above.

hostname of the machine:  hostname

Find Files:

1) cd practise/editors
2) find /home/virendra -name "name.txt" 
   ( it will search for all the directories and sub-directories of the virendra)
3) find /home/virendra -name "*.txt"  
   ( to find all the files ending with .txt)

6) zip file FifthBeatles.txt beatles.txt
   ( this will create zipped file)
7) ls -lh

unpacking archived/zipped:
we will not unpack in same directory of editors because after unpacking it will replace the previous files os data losses chances are higher. to avoid this we will create a new directory and unapck over there

Syntax: 
(a) tar xf file.gz -C directoryname
(b) tar xf file.bz2 -C directoryname
(c) unzip file.zip -d directoryname

1) cd practise/editors
2) mkdir one
3) tar xf file.tar -C /home/virendra/practise/one
   (here x stands for extract and -C tell path or name of directory where you want to extract
    here one is the directory which we created)
4) cd one
5) ls -l

=================================================================================

Links:
Hard link is having same size of the file
Soft link only stores the address of the file as a pointer so size of soft file is very small
1) cd practise/editors
2) ls
3) ln beatles.txt filex          ( this will create hard link)
4) ln -s FifthBeatles.txt filey  ( this will create the soft link)
5) ls -l

   ( you will notice filex and beatles.txt will have same node number)
